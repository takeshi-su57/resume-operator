## PR Size Guidelines

| Size   | Lines Changed | Recommendation         |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| XS     | 1-10          | Quick review           |
| Small  | 11-100        | Ideal size             |
| Medium | 101-300       | Acceptable             |
| Large  | 301-500       | Consider splitting     |
| XL     | 500+          | Split into smaller PRs |

## Key Rules

1. **Keep PRs small** — easier to review, fewer bugs, faster merge
2. **One concern per PR** — don't mix features, fixes, and refactors
3. **Descriptive title** — reviewers should understand the change at a glance
4. **Link issues** — use the full issue URL (e.g. `Resolves https://github.com/takeshi-su57/lucky-plan/issues/123`) since issues live in a separate repository. Never use shorthand `#123` references
5. **Self-review first** — review your own diff before requesting others
6. **Add context** — explain _why_, not just _what_ changed
7. **Use draft PRs** — for work-in-progress to get early feedback
8. **Respond to all comments** — resolve or discuss every review comment before merging
